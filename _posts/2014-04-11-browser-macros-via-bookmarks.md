You can easily store java script snippets as bookmarks and run them on different browsers simply by clicking on the bookmark. 
This helps axoot if yiu have custom made java scripts to do repeating tasks on websites. 
For example, if you want to invite all yiur friends to a page or add everyone on a group, you can simply run a script.
All this scripts can stored as bookmarks for easy access. This is somewhat similar to what greecemonkey is doing but without any extensions. To run java scripts simply use the following snippet as your location of the bookmark.


`javascript: function({YOUR JAVASCRIPTÂ ; return false;})()`
