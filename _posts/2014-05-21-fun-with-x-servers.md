Was exposed to concept of x servers today. Itâ€™s simply amazing. There are lots of stuff you can do with an X displays. For example :

extend your display to multiple displays attached to different machines.

push or pullcontent from and to different display others are using

create wall like extended displays even without a graphic card attached.

Main architecture

Graphical user display and the machine it runs on are decoupled. Similar to a modern website. As a result you can view the screen of another machine as you would browse websites. Further more these screens can be shared as well.
