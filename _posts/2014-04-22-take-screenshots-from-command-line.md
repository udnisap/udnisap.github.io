Gnome allows taking screenshots from command line. Useful when you want to capture screen shots with context menus as the print screen button does not work when a right click menu appears. Use it with a delay to solve it.

gnome-screenshot

To capture with a delay

gnome-screenshot -d 5     

Interactive mode for more information 

gnome-screenshot -i
