This is cool trick I knew sometime back which works on any browser. Simply add ”SS” before the domain of the video url and you can download the video.
To try out lets take `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfkRT8IS_xs` to download this go to `https://www.ssyoutube.com/watch?v=TfkRT8IS_xs`. Yes it is simple as that.
