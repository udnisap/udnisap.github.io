Today I came across a very interesting shell. They call it FISH. It can be considered as one of the very few user friendly and highly scriptable shell. Simply install and see the difference.

apt-get install fish
fish

Some of the features I love about fish
Main feature I love about it is that it automatically auto complete the commands. You do not need to press tab. Further more it gives the documentation inline as well.
Further more it scans through man pages and provide help inlineÂ
